# <span style="font-size: 3rem">**Minion Speak ðŸ˜ƒ**</span>

### A web app build with **HTML** , **CSS** ,  and **Vanilla JS** .

### The motive of this app was to build a beginner's level  web app to undertstand the various functionalities of **Javascript**. 
<br>

## **Minion Speak is a translator application.**
Users can provide any english sentence/word as an input to the web application and the translator converts that input sentence to **minion language**.
<br><br>

<span style="font-size:2rem">**Project Details**</span><br>
The javascript part of the web application uses the concepts of 
**DOM** (Document Object Model) such as **document** interface , 
**querySelector()** method of document and **addEventListener** method.<br><br>

To implemenet the translator I used <span style="font-size:1.25rem">**[funtranslations](https://funtranslations.com/)**</span> api. For this application the <span style="font-size:1.25rem">**[minion api](https://funtranslations.com/api/minion)**</span> provided by funtranslations have been used. To use these external APIs in the application we used **fetch()** api which provides an interface for fetching resources via urls.
